# PhoneBook(Functional_Programming)
In this C++ program, I wrote my own algorithms and structured them in a way that reflects functional programming style. It obtains the same results as HW 3.2 and I  created a universal myTransform template function that can accept a range of elements, do some operation on them based on a certain predicate, and output the result in another range.
